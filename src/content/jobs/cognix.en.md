Website integration (conversion of PSD mockups into HTML and CSS code). I have completed around a hundred websites, each integration taking between one and two days, depending on the complexity of the mockup and the number of pages to integrate.

I also participated in the development of templates for a new online store module (cart, payment tunnel...) of the CMS sold by the company.
