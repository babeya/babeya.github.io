* Administration of a Prestashop site and development of add-ons.
* Migration to a Laravel site based on the API of the previous Prestashop site.
* Development of a new API and a front-end in React to replace the old technical stack. We had many issues because the Prestashop API was designed for reading and not for writing, as it did not perform the necessary checks before inserting data (e.g., verifying that a discount coupon had not already been used by customers), leading to a lot of fraud and repeated server crashes.
* Assistance in the development of a mobile application (API modification, documentation, monitoring the progress of the application, and organizing internal tests).
* Recruitment and internal training.
* Implementation of a complete CICD with automatic deployment of the API and front-end in an auto-scaled cluster of AWS instances.
* Implementation of an event-based tracking system for services like Mixpanel (CMS) and Google Analytics.
* Implementation of a data extraction and statistics service for the sales department.
* Integration of an automatic mailing tool (MailJet) and SMS sending to inform customers about the status of their orders and deliveries.
* Integration of email templates (in table format, with extended compatibility on most email clients, even old ones, which was difficult to achieve at the time with NoCode tools).
* Technical referent of the company (interaction and meetings with various external providers: The Family, AWS Paris, mobile development company).
