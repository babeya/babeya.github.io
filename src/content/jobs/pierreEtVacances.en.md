* Participation in the development of an application for interactive kiosks (similar to McDonaldâ€™s kiosks) for on-site activity reservations. The application operated with web components and an in-house framework handling authentication, navigation, and payment via the kiosk's APIs.
* Development of a "driver" for printing tickets from the interactive kiosk (a reservation would trigger the printing of a ticket with a QR code and all reservation details).
* Development of the new Pierre et Vacances mobile application in React Native, particularly the scheduling systems, activity reservations, stay bookings, and site pages.
* Assistance in maintaining existing applications (MyPVCP, Center Parcs).
* POC on integrating a ChatBot via online NLP (Natural Language Processing) APIs.
