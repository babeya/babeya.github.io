* Participation in the development of applications for Samsung TV (Tizen) and LG (WebOS) using an in-house framework.
* Assistance in the maintenance of the AppleTV (tvOS) application initially, followed by complete takeover of its management.
* Development of the PlayStation 4 application (webmaf).
* Interaction with Samsung and PlayStation (Sony) development support services located abroad.
* Development of an asynchronous library based on Promises as an overlay on the basic PlayStation API (sending a message with a function and listening to a stream while waiting for responses in a flow of system information).
* Development of navigation optimizations: on TV and PlayStation, the RAM allocated to applications is very low. Off-screen elements must be purged to avoid application freezes and crashes. Often, navigation is done step by step, to allow time for animation to occur and properly manage different components. We developed a unique system at the time for smooth scrolling.
* Creation of "unique" pages for AppleTV using small tricks, as TVML (the programming language on AppleTV) was very limited in its native capabilities at the time.
* Demonstration of TV applications to external providers (Disney, OCS).
