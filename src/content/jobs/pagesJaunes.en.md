Development of an open-source tool for data search and visualization in an ElasticSearch cluster (Curiosity). The objective of the internship was to redevelop a POC created by the data teams at Pages Jaunes from jQuery to AngularJS (1.X). The objective was quickly achieved, and we added new features to the tool:

* Advanced search system (keywords, aggregations, or facets)
* Result templating system, allowing data to be visualized in a structured way (graph, table, etc.)
* Dashboard system based on templating to display information in the cluster, automatically refreshed (inspired by Google Analytics)

I also wrote the documentation and participated in internal presentations and competitions (which we won), with the aim of sharing our tool with as many people as possible, both within the company and externally.
