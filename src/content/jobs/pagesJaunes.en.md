Development of an open-source tool for data search and visualization in an ElasticSearch cluster (Curiosity). The objective of the internship was to redevelop a POC created by the data teams at Pages Jaunes from jQuery to AngularJS (1.X) :

* Advanced search system (keywords, aggregations, or facets).
* Result templating system, allowing data to be visualized in a structured way (graph, table, etc.).
* Dashboard system based on templating to display information in the cluster, automatically refreshed.
