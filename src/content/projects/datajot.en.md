DataJot is an iOS/iPadOS/macOS app I’m developing to experiment with SwiftData, SwiftUI, and App Intents.
The goal: to create a lightweight, fully customizable equivalent of Apple’s Health app.

Main features :

* Create custom numeric series
* Local storage with SwiftData, App Group, and iCloud sync
* Widgets to quickly view and add values
* Integration with the Shortcuts app via App Intents for automated input and retrieval
* Privacy-focused: no account, no tracking

This project allows me to explore in depth:

* Data modeling and persistence with SwiftData
* Integrating widgets and App Intents into a unified flow
* Seamless synchronization through iCloud
* Best practices for multi-platform Apple development
